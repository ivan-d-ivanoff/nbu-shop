# Shop
This code resembles a basic implementation of how a shop would work.

## Functionalities
A user can create a shop.
Each shop can have its own items' pricing markup (based on expred dates, product type, etc.) and cashiers.
A shop also has inventory that holds all of its goods.
When someone wants to buy an item, a receipt will be printed out (saved to a new file) and will contain
all the important information, regarding the purchase.
